Entry 12:
Worked on installing Windows in a virtual machine.
Learned how disk partitions work during OS installation.
Key rule: always install the OS on the largest Primary partition.
In my case, Disk 0 Partition 3 (99.1 GB) was the correct choice.
This helped me understand how storage is allocated in VMs.
